"""Trusted offline evaluator for Biome parser/formatter throughput.

The image contains the pinned upstream tree, cargo-vendored dependencies, the
protected benchmark runner, and a prebuilt target seed. Only the four parser /
formatter `src` trees are overlaid from the candidate. Cargo, tests, and the
runner execute as the injected worker uid, which cannot traverse the root-only asset mount.

Robustness model: mutable crate code is linked into the benchmark runner, so
nothing the runner process reports (stdout, timing, exit status alone) is
trusted. This parent process measures wall time itself, seals the built runner
at a root-owned path so it cannot be swapped mid-evaluation, and gates
correctness over the same frozen corpus the benchmark times: every workload —
valid JS/TS/CSS, deliberately malformed recovery JS AND CSS, and formatter
edge constructs — must reproduce the frozen byte-exact formatted output,
diagnostic hashes, and idempotence, and then runs under the timed benchmark
path. There is no separate gate-only runner mode: the runner's argv shapes are
exactly `verify` (oracle check) and `parse|format INPUT REPS NONCE` (timed
legs), so a candidate cannot detect a regression gate and route to a special
correct path, and no fixed gate-only input strings ship in the harness.

Completion binding: iteration selection and per-iteration validation live in
this trusted parent, never in a candidate-authored completion file or receipt.
The parent draws a fresh per-sample nonce and drives both the candidate runner
and the pristine reference runner with it; each folds every timed iteration's
protected probe observations into a nonce-keyed proof returned over the
parent-owned stdout pipe. A sample counts only when the candidate's proof
equals the reference's proof for that nonce — possible only if the candidate
actually executed every timed iteration over the pinned parser/formatter
output. Because each iteration's input is a nonce/iteration-keyed rotation of
the frozen source, a candidate special-casing exact input bytes (including the
recovery constructs) diverges at the rotated iterations and cannot match.

Isolation model: every timed leg runs in a fresh cgroup2 measurement leaf
(joined while root, before privilege drop) whose kernel memory.peak is the
whole-tree RSS accounting, and in a fresh mount+IPC namespace with a brand-new
/tmp, /dev/shm, and /var/tmp, so no scratch, POSIX/SysV shm, or on-disk residue
carries parser/formatter state between legs. Between legs the evaluator (a
subreaper) kills and reaps every candidate-uid process so no candidate residue
runs while the reference leg is timed.

Scoring model: per workload/mode the candidate and reference alternate over
BENCH_BATCHES fresh-process legs with per-file repetitions frozen at ~0.6s of
work per leg; the score is a frozen anchor scaled by the geometric mean over
workloads of the per-workload MEDIAN per-pair reference/candidate wall-time
ratio (candidate and reference in one batch run back-to-back against the same
instantaneous host load, so the ratio cancels common-mode contention within
the pair, and the median rejects pairs where a short burst hit only one leg),
so thin true margins survive noisy shared hosts.

    reference. Per workload/mode the candidate and the reference each run
    BENCH_BATCHES times in fresh measurement leaves and fresh per-leg mount/IPC
    namespaces, strictly alternating so both binaries sample the same
    wall-clock window; the estimator is the median of per-pair ratios:
    each batch's candidate and reference legs run back-to-back against the
    same instantaneous host load, so their per-rep ratio cancels common-mode
    contention within the pair, and the per-workload ratio is
        ratio = median(reference per-rep / candidate per-rep, per batch)
    The median (unlike a mean/geomean of pairs) also rejects the pairs where
    a contention burst shorter than the two-leg window hit only one leg —
    the dominant residual noise on a shared host under sustained load.
    Repetitions come from a frozen per-file table (challenge.json)
    calibrated so every timed leg is ~0.6s of work regardless of file size,
    equalizing each workload's exposure to load. The score is the frozen
    anchor scaled by the geometric mean of the per-workload/mode ratios:
        q = REFERENCE_ANCHOR_Q * geomean(ratio per workload/mode)
    (the reported per-workload measurement keeps min(candidate per-rep) as a
    diagnostic only).

    Completion binding (ADAPTER/ITER): iteration selection and per-iteration
    validation live in the trusted parent, never in a candidate-authored file.
    The parent draws a fresh per-sample nonce and drives BOTH the candidate and
    the reference with it; each runner folds every timed iteration's protected
    probe observations into a nonce-keyed proof returned over the parent-owned
    stdout pipe. A sample counts only when the candidate's proof equals the
    pristine reference's proof for that nonce, which is possible only if the
    candidate actually executed every timed iteration over the pinned parser /
    formatter output. A process that computed the base once and exited, or that
    skipped rotations/probes, produces no matching proof. The warmup uses a
    distinct nonce, so nothing precomputed during warmup can satisfy a scored
    leg. RSS is the kernel cgroup memory.peak from candidate legs only.
