"""Trusted offline evaluator for the simdjson DOM/On-Demand parse capsule.

Gaming-resistance model
-----------------------
* Timing is performed by THIS trusted parent process (``time.monotonic``),
  around a harness that never reports its own timing. The candidate parser is
  linked into that harness, but the wall clock lives in a separate,
  non-candidate-linked process, so a ``clock_gettime`` / benchmark-JSON
  override inside the candidate object cannot bias the measurement.
* Speed is a candidate/reference ratio from two-point measurements (``N`` and
  ``2N`` iterations of the SAME reused parser). Subtracting the two wall times
  cancels process startup, memfd exec, file load and teardown; dividing by the
  frozen TRUSTED reference parser — rebuilt in this eval and timed interleaved
  with the candidate — cancels host-load drift; per-point minima across rounds
  reject one-sided load bursts.
* Correctness is validated in this parent against expected event hashes that
  live ONLY in the protected asset mount (``/capsule/assets/assets/<split>/
  expected.json``); they are never staged into the candidate-readable corpus
  and never shipped in the /workspace baseline tree.
* Timed iterations are identity-distinct: the trusted harness perturbs value
  bytes deterministically before every iteration after the first (structure
  and size preserved) and folds each perturbed iteration's full event stream
  into a CHAIN line this parent validates against the trusted reference's
  chain at the same iteration count, so repeated timed work can neither be
  memoized (no two iterations parse identical bytes) nor skipped (every
  iteration's parse output is validated). Candidate-writable residue in
  /tmp, /dev/shm, and SysV IPC is purged between launches so deterministic
  chains cannot be cached across runs either.

        of each round run back-to-back (lead alternating) as a PAIR, and the
        estimator is the geometric mean of the per-pair reference/candidate
        wall-time ratios. Running the legs adjacently makes the sustained host
        contention they see nearly identical, so it cancels inside each pair's
        ratio; the geomean then tightens as 1/sqrt(pairs). This drives the A-A

        two independently-lucky minima from different load instants) left it

        fixed per-process overhead (exec, file load, site scan) stays a
        negligible common-mode term in every ratio.

        Iteration 1 of every run parses the PRISTINE document and must

        parses a distinct, deterministically value-perturbed variant (trusted

        perturbed iteration's full event stream into a CHAIN line. The trusted
        reference runs first at each iteration count and pins the expected
        chain; every subsequent run at that count must reproduce it exactly,
        so timed work can neither be memoized (no two iterations see the same
