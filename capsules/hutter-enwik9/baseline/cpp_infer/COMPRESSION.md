# Lossless weights-file compression

Alternative save (Python) / load (C++) functions for `cpp_infer/data/weights.bin`.
The original `write_tensor_file` / `WeightsFile::load` are untouched;
`bin/test_weights_compressed <reference.bin> <compressed>` verifies that both
loaders yield bit-for-bit identical tensors.

- encoder / Python decoder: `pysrc/weights_compress.py`
  (`write_tensor_file_v1/v2`, `read_tensor_file_v1/v2`, CLI
  `compress` (v2) / `compress1` (v1) / `decompress` / `verify`)
- C++ decoder: `WeightsFile::load_compressed` in
  `src/weights_io_compressed.cpp` (dispatches on the magic; compiled `-Os`,
  it is load-time-only code)

## Results (reference file: 39,615,533 bytes)

| format | size | ratio |
|---|---|---|
| FX2TFW01 (original) | 39,615,533 | 1.00x |
| FX2TFWC1 (v1: log2(15) bits/int4 weight, rest raw) | 36,613,691 | 1.08x |
| FX2TFWC2 (v2: everything below) | 2,930,652 | 13.52x |
| FX2TFWC3 (v3: v2 + adaptive frequency counts for the int8 payloads, see below) | v2 − 28 KB | |

v1 stores each of the 5,868,864 quantized int4 weights (15 possible values,
[-7, 7]) at log2(15) = 3.907 bits via a range coder with a uniform 1/15 model;
bf16/f32/i32 payloads and metadata stay raw.

## v2: ideas tried, and gain vs. decompressor-code cost

Marginal decompressor code measured on `-Os` `.text` by ablating one feature
at a time (whole v1+v2 decoder: 4,889 bytes of code; at the default `-O3` it
inflates to 20.7 KB for zero benefit, hence the `-Os` rule in the Makefile).

| idea | bytes saved | marginal code | kept |
|---|---|---|---|
| recompute rope.sin/rope.cos instead of storing (33,554,432 B of f32) | 33,554,432 | 1,160 B | yes |
| int4: adaptive 15-symbol bit-tree instead of uniform 1/15 (3.786 vs 3.907 bits/weight) | 63,347 | 202 B | yes |
| bf16 scales: adaptive hi-byte model + lo-byte model contexted on hi (52,166 B raw -> 23,377) | 28,789 | 324 B | yes |
| non-rope f32 + i32: per-byte-plane adaptive models (113,216 B raw -> 97,312) | 15,904 | 196 B | yes |
| tensor names: order-2 adaptive char model (22,213 B raw -> 5,038) | 17,175 | ~0 B | yes |
| metadata (dtype/ndim/shape/lengths): order-1 byte model (6,672 B raw -> 1,622) | 5,050 | shared | yes |

Ideas measured and **not** used:
- order-1 context for int4 weights (previous weight): conditional entropy
  3.7858 vs 3.7860 bits — the quantized weights are essentially i.i.d.
- per-tensor int4 frequency tables: +3.7 KB over global adaptive at best,
  adaptation already captures it.
- rope as correctly-rounded sin + coded ulp deltas (the fallback if exact
  recomputation had failed): deltas are only {-1,0,+1} but cost 0.63
  bits/value even with rounding-boundary-distance context, ~660 KB total —
  obsoleted by the exact reproduction.

## Recomputing the rope tables bit-exactly

`rope.sin`/`rope.cos` are `torch.outer(arange(131072), inv_freq).sin()/.cos()`
computed in fp32 on CUDA — 85% of the file, but fully determined by the
128-byte `rope.inv_freq`. The decoder reproduces CUDA's `sinf`/`cosf`
bit-exactly with a host port of libdevice `__nv_sinf`/`__nv_cosf`, transcribed
from the LLVM IR of `/usr/local/cuda/nvvm/libdevice/libdevice.10.bc` (CUDA
13.0): Cody-Waite 3-step FMA reduction for |a| < 105615, Payne-Hanek integer
reduction above, shared polynomial kernel (cos = sin with quadrant + 1).
Verified bit-identical on all 8,388,608 table entries, including the 25,457
Payne-Hanek arguments (position*inv_freq[0] >= 105615).

The Python encoder verifies recomputability before dropping the tables (and
falls back to storing them if the check fails, e.g. for a checkpoint whose
tables came from different hardware). Its emulation reproduces `fmaf` exactly:
double arithmetic (exact product + one rounding) with a detect-and-redo of
double-rounding hazards via exact rational arithmetic.

## Stream format (v2)

`FX2TFWC2` magic, `u32 n_tensors`, then a single LZMA-style range-coded
stream (11-bit adaptive binary probabilities, shift-5 update, bit-tree symbol
coding). Per tensor: name length + name chars + dtype + ndim + 4-byte dims +
encoding byte, then the payload per the encoding
(`ENC_RAW/INT4/BF16/PLANE4/ROPE_SIN/ROPE_COS`). The Python encoder and both
decoders must stay in exact sync.

Decode time for the full file: < 0.3 s single-threaded (EPYC 7702).

## v3 (FX2TFWC3, 2026-09-19): adaptive frequency counts for the int8 payloads

`FX2TFWC3` magic, `u32 n_tensors`, then the v2 stream with one change: every
DT_I8 tensor whose values fit in [-127, 127] (quantized weights, codebook level
indices, `.codebook` tensors, the 8-bit token/prior/unembedding tables of
`--wbits-small 8` exports) uses encoding `ENC_ADAPT = 6`: one extra metadata
byte `qmax` (= max |value|, coded with the order-1 meta model), then the values
`v + qmax` in `[0, 2*qmax]` coded with an adaptive frequency-count model,
one model per tensor (`AdaptModel` on both sides):

- K = 2*qmax+1 counts, seeded from the running counts of every symbol coded
  so far in tensors of the same alphabet (integer-scaled so the seed totals
  960, each count >= 1; flat 1s for the first tensor of an alphabet)
- +1 per coded symbol; when the total exceeds 2^16 all counts are halved
  (`(c+1) >> 1`), which also keeps `range / total >= 2^8` in the 32-bit coder
- the symbol is coded as `r = range / total; low += r*cum; range = r*count`,
  except that the LAST symbol takes the whole remainder `[r*cum, range)`, so
  no probability mass is wasted (measured coder loss: 7 bytes on 5.8M weights)

Why it helps: the quantized weights are i.i.d. within a tensor (neighbour
and position contexts carry no information once per-tensor overfitting is
removed), so the only thing left to improve is the estimator's noise.  The v2
bit tree (11-bit probabilities, shift-5 = an effective window of ~32
observations per node) costs 3.823 bits/weight on the shipped recipe against
an order-0 per-tensor entropy of 3.783; counts get 3.7845.  Measured on real
exports (Python encoder, C++ decoder bit-identical in both cases):

| export | v2 | v3 | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| lex_v1_run2 bf16 (`export_bf16`, 434 tensors) | 2,874,900 | 2,846,589 | −28,311 |
| qat_dynmm_e8 `--wbits-small 8 --actq-dynamic-mm` (325 tensors) | 2,737,667 | 2,710,488 | −27,179 |

(of the second, 952 bytes come from the three 8-bit tables, which v2 pushed
through the order-0 raw byte model.)  Offline study of alternatives, all on
the run2 int4 stream (`work/neural/NOTES.md`, 2026-09-19 04:55 and 13:40):
per-tensor vs global counts −2.5 KB, seeding from the running distribution
−0.6 KB, same-shape seeding another −0.1 KB (not taken), count increment 1 vs
2 −0.1 KB, halving limit 2^14..2^17 all within ±20 B, left/up/left2 neighbour
contexts +3..+30 KB (worse), a "row already had a ±7" context −0.6 KB before
learning cost (not taken).  Decoder code: +0.9 KB of `-Os` text (arm64 proxy;
the x86-64 delta is in the build logs), decode time unchanged (~0.1 s).

The weights count twice in the Hutter S, so the container change alone is
worth about −56 KB of S.  `python -m pysrc.weights_compress compress3` writes
v3; both decoders still read v1/v2 (the `.tfwc2` file extension is kept for
v3 files: the loaders dispatch on the magic).
