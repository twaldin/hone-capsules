"""Trusted evaluator for microsoft/mimalloc allocator throughput.

Exec-boundary design: the benchmark harness executables are compiled by THIS
trusted evaluator, as root, from the sealed TRUSTED_DIR sources only, and link
NO allocator code. The allocator under measurement (candidate or pristine
reference) is built as a shared library by a demoted worker, and the trusted
harness dlopens it only AFTER the parent-owned control channel authenticates,
so no candidate instruction can execute at benchmark process startup or ahead
of the trusted protocol. The parent owns the wall clock, a fresh per-sample
go-nonce delivered at clock-start, a per-sample paired plausibility floor
against the interleaved pristine reference, and kernel-owned cgroup memory
readings that reject timed windows lacking workload-scale allocation.
